Title
Git-Based File Access Utility Using Python Application

Description
We need to build a Python utility that can programmatically fetch and read files directly from a Git repository.
The utility should be capable of accessing specific files (e.g., config.json, data.yaml) by:

Connecting to a provided Git repository URL.

Optionally checking out a specific branch or tag.

Retrieving the file contents for use within the application.

This will serve as a foundational module to manage configurations and resources in a centralized, version-controlled manner.

Acceptance Criteria
Repository Access

The Python application can connect to a public or private Git repository.

File Retrieval

The utility can retrieve a specific file by its path from the repository.

It supports specifying branches or tags when fetching the file.

Content Reading

The utility can read the file contents (e.g., text, JSON) after retrieval.

Authentication (Optional)

For private repositories, the utility should support authentication (via SSH key or personal access token).

Error Handling

Proper error messages for missing files, wrong paths, authentication issues, or network failures.

Reusable Functionality

The code should be modular and reusable as a Python function or class.
